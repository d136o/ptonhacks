Princeton's First Hardware Hackathon.

We're looking for people to tinker and make cool things. Make a plan for a project that costs <$200, submit it, and if we think it's of weekend scope and it's cool enough then we'll buy the stuff for you. Be creative, make the next tweeting toilet, the next w.e. it is.

Want to submit a project? Want to help me organize this? Want to find a team? Reach out and we'll help, we want to make this a memorable event.
