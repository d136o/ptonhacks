Here are a few sample projects. These will give you an idea of the types of projects that inspired the event. The only limitations to keep in mind are time and budget. Minimize cost, make sure it can be done over a weekend, and make sure you think it's cool. The lower bound is a tweeting toilet, if it's cooler and can still be done over a weekend you're going in the right direction. (email us about any other cool projects you've come across!)
